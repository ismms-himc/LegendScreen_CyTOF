# LEGENDScreen Antibody Staining Dataset

The LEGENDScreen Antibody Staining Dataset is a comprehensive dataset performed by the Human Immune Monitoring Center at Mt. Sinai that profiles the marker expression of 300+ antibodies on all major immune subsets in circulating blood at a single-cell resolution generated using Biolegend's LEGENDScreen kit (https://www.biolegend.com/en-us/legendscreen) and a comprehensive mass cytometry pipeline.
